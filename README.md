For this talk I prepared a presentation to discuss Gartner's 2014 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies study and some experiments that covers OmniChannel Interactions for Netshoes projects.
tags for this talk are `leap` `threejs` `kinect` `omnichannel` `bci` `braincomputerinterface` `raspberry` `arduino` `drones` `johnnyfive`

There are other talks but I still grabbing stuff to populate this box :-)
